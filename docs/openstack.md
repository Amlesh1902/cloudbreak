#OpenStack based installation

We have pre-built a custom OpenStack image available on VM Depot with all the required tooling and Cloudbreak deployer installed. In order to launch this image on OpenStack please use the following [image]().

Cloudbreak will already be installed, thus you can follow these steps to launch the application.

## Usage

Once the Cloudbreak deployer is installed it will generate some config files and will download supporting binaries. It is
advised that you create a dedicated directory for it:

```
mkdir cloudbreak-deployment
cd cloudbreak-deployment
```

### Initialize Profile

First initialize your directory by creating a `Profile` file:

```
cbd init
```

It will create a `Profile` file in the current directory. Please edit the file - the only required
configuration is the `PUBLIC_IP`. This IP will be used to access the Cloudbreak UI
(called Uluwatu). In some cases the `cbd` tool tries to guess it, if can't than will give a hint.

#### Change default username/Password

The default credentials can be revealed by `cbd login` These values are used in the `uaa.yml` file's end section. To change these values, add 2 lines into your Profile:

```
export UAA_DEFAULT_USER_EMAIL=myself@example.com
export UAA_DEFAULT_USER_PW=demo123
```

#### Regenerate your Profile

You are done with the configuration of Cloudbreak deployer. The last thing you have to do is to regenerate the configurations in order to take effect.

```
rm *.yml
cbd generate
```

#### Verify configs

In order to verify that all configs are OK use the `doctor` command.

```
cbd doctor
```


### Start Cloudbreak

To start all the containers run:

```
cbd start
```

Launching the first time will take more time as it does some additional steps:

- download all the docker images, needed by Cloudbreak.
- create **docker-compose.yml**: Full configuration of containers needed for the Cloudbreak deployment.
- create **uaa.yml**: Identity Server configuration.

This will start all the Docker containers and initialize the application. Please give a few minutes until all services starts. While the services are starting you can check the logs.

### Watch the logs

```
cbd logs
```

## Default Credentials

The default credentials can be revealed by `cbd login`

These values are used in the `uaa.yml` end section. To change these values, add 2 lines into your Profile:

```
export UAA_DEFAULT_USER_EMAIL=myself@example.com
export UAA_DEFAULT_USER_PW=demo123
```
and than you need to recreate configs:
```
rm *.yml
cbd generate
```
