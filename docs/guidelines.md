###Contributing code

We are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as possible. Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request? Do it! We will appreciate it.
The Cloudbreak projects are open source and developed/distributed under the [Apache Software License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html). 
If you wish to contribute to Cloudbreak (which you're very welcome and encouraged to do so) then you must agree to release the rights of your source under this license.

####Creating issues

Any significant improvement should be documented as a GitHub issue before starting to work on it. Please use the appropriate labels - bug, enhancement, etc - this helps while creating the release notes for a version release. 
Before submitting issues please check for duplicate or similar issues. If you are unclear about an issue please feel free to contact us.

####Discuss your design 

We recommend discussing your plans on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cloudbreak) before starting to code - especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give feedback on your design, and maybe point out if someone else is working on the same thing.

####Conventions

Please write clean code. Universally formatted code promotes ease of writing, reading, and maintenance. Always use our [checkstyle](https://gist.github.com/martonsereg/9390889).
