# Preprovision configurations

Follow the [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication#service_accounts) in Google Cloud's documentation to create a `Service account` and `Generate a new P12 key`.

Make sure that at API level (**APIs and auth** menu) you have enabled:

* Google Compute Engine
* Google Compute Engine Instance Group Manager API
* Google Compute Engine Instance Groups API
* BigQuery API
* Google Cloud Deployment Manager API
* Google Cloud DNS API
* Google Cloud SQL
* Google Cloud Storage
* Google Cloud Storage JSON API

When creating GCP credentials in Cloudbreak you will have to provide the email address of the Service Account and the project ID (from Google Developers Console - Projects) where the service account is created. You'll also have to upload the generated P12 file and provide an OpenSSH formatted public key that will be used as an SSH key.

Once Cloudbreak is up and running you can launch clusters in two different ways. You can follow the [Provisioning prerequisites](gcp_pre_provision.md).
