##Cloudbreak UI

When we have started to work on Cloudbreak our main goal was to create an easy to use, cloud and Hadoop distribution agnostis Hadoop as a Service API. Though we always like to automate everything and aproach things with a very DevOps mindset, as a side project we have created a UI for Cloudbreak as well.
The goal of the UI is to ease to process and allow you to create a Hadoop cluster on your favorite cloud provider in `one-click`. 

The UI is built on the foundation of the Cloudbreak REST API.
