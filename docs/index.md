Cloudbreak is a cloud agnostic Hadoop as a Service API. Abstracts the provisioning and ease management and monitoring of on-demand HDP clusters in different virtual environments. Once it is deployed in your favorite servlet container exposes a REST API allowing to span up Hadoop clusters of arbitrary sizes on your selected cloud provider. Provisioning Hadoop has never been easier.
Cloudbreak is built on the foundation of cloud providers API (Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform, OpenStack), Apache Ambari, Docker containers, Swarm and Consul.

For a detailed overview please follow this [link](http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak-deployer/docsupdate/overview/)

For recent changes please check the [changelog](http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak-deployer/latest/changelog/).

Cloudbreak has two main components - the [Cloudbreak deployer](http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak-deployer) and the [Cloudbreak application](http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak). Cloudbreak deployer helps you to deploy the Cloudbreak application automatically in environments with Docker support. Once the Cloudbreak application is deployed you can use it to provision HDP clusters in different cloud environments.

##Technology

For an architectural overview of the CLoudbreak deployer and application please follow this [link](http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak-deployer/docsupdate/technology/)

##Installation

Currently only **Linux** and **OSX** 64 bit binaries are released for Cloudbreak Deployer. For anything else we can create a special Docker container. The deployment itself needs only **Docker 1.7.0** or later.

####DIY installation

For on premise installations of the Cloudbreak application please follow the [link](http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak-deployer/docsupdate/onprem)

####AWS based installation

We have pre-built custom cloud images with Cloudbreak deployer pre-configured. Following the steps will guide you through the provider specific configuration and launching clusters using that provider.

## Credits

This tool, and the PR driven release, is inspired from [glidergun](https://github.com/gliderlabs/glidergun). Actually it
could be a fork of it. The reason itâ€™s not a fork, because we wanted to have our own binary with all modules
built in, so only a single binary is needed.
