The auto-scaling capabilities is based on Ambari Metrics - and Ambari Alerts. Based on the Blueprint used and the running services, Cloudbreak can access all the available metrics from the subsystem and define alerts based on this information.

Beside the default Ambari Metrics, Cloudbreak includes two custom metrics: Pending YARN containers and Pending applications. These two custom metrics works with the YARN subsystem in order to bring application level QoS to the cluster.
