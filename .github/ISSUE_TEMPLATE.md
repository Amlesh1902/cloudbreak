_Only use Github issues to report bugs or feature requests_

For example, _Timeouts waiting for SSH/Ambari are generally not bugs within cloudbreak and are better addressed by the HCC channel. Ask on HCC if you are unsure.

If you are planning to open a pull-request just open the pull-request instead of making an issue first.
