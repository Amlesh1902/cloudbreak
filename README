Cloudbreak
==========

Cloudbreak is the tool to provision and manage Apache Hadoop clusters in the cloud. Cloudbreak can be used to launch clusters in public cloud infrastructure platforms such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform. Cloudbreak uses Docker technology to deploy the requisite containers cloud-agnostically and uses Apache Ambari (via Ambari Blueprints) to install and manage the Hadoop cluster. Cloudbreak tool itself is delivered as a set of docker containers so installation of Cloudbreak involve downloading and running bunch of Docker containers which comprises the Cloudbreak tool.  

## Requirements

To run Cloudbreak, following systems requirements must be met:
- RedHat / CentOS / Oracle Linux 6 (64-bit)
- Docker 1.6.0 (or later)
- Internet connectivity to access public docker registry or private docker registry in-house.
